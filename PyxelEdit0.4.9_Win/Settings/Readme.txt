Pyxel Edit checks this directory for settings files before the application storage directory, but cannot write to this directory.
Copy your settings files here if you want to set them as defaults for your portable version of Pyxel Edit.

(the config files are saved to the application storage directory on exit, usually located at C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\PyxelEdit on Windows and /Users/[username]/Library/Application Support/PyxelEdit on Mac)
